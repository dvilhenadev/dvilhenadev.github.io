<h2>About all of this</h2>

<p>My name is Daniel Vilhena, a physicist and a mathematician - or as I like to say: Daniel Vilhena, MScÂ².</p>

<p>The design of the page is supposed to be plain, as a tribute to the pages of yore built solely with HTML and CSS. 
    Which allows me to have some simple fun as well and create some interesting easter eggs.</p>

    <p>I have worked mostly on materials and condensed matter physics, quantum computation and currently am employed as a machine learning engineer. 
        Outside of my academic and professional life, my interestes are mostly cinema (mostly horror and science-fiction), anime, literature and visual arts. 
        I used to be an avid gamer, but the most hardcore I've gone in the last couple of years was Tears of the Kingdom and Sonic Origins.

    <p>
        I don't quite know yet what this blog will be, but it will be a journey that I have finally started after postponing it for so long.
