    About all of this

    My name is Daniel Vilhena, physicist and mathematician - or as I like to say: Daniel Vilhena, MScÂ².
   
    <br>
    The design of the page is supposed to be plain, as a tribute to the pages of yore built solely with HTML and CSS. 
    Which allows me to have some simple fun as well and create some interesting easter eggs.
    <br>
    I have worked mostly on condensed matter physics, quantum computation and currently am employed as a machine learning engineer. 
    Outside of my academic and professional life, my interests are cinema (mostly horror and science-fiction), anime, literature and visual arts. 
    I used to be an avid gamer, but the most hardcore I've gone in the last couple of years was Tears of the Kingdom and Sonic Origins. Shin Megami Tensei V for a couple of weeks as well.

    I don't quite know yet what this blog will be, but it will be a journey that I have finally started after postponing it for so long.
    <br>
    <br>
    P.S.: I apologize to all the mobile users. Still working on that.
